# Sunnyside Responsive Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS, based on static design mockups. The layout adapts to desktop and mobile screen sizes and was developed with a mobile-first approach.

> This challenge is based on a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) layout.
> Design files were provided as static `.jpg` mockups only (no Figma), and the project was coded from scratch.
